#if volume is mounted
sudo umount /mnt/volume_lon1_02

sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda

sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sda my_encrypted_volume

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume

sudo mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume /mnt/volume_lon1_02

sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sda my_encrypted_volume

sudo mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume /mnt/volume_lon1_02





##my start up file


vncserver -geometry 1600x900 :33

sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sda my_encrypted_volume

sudo mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume /mnt/volume_lon1_02

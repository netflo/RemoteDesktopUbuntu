works on Ubuntu22

as per https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-desktop-aws#1-overview

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -yy ubuntu-desktop tightvncserver gnome-panel gnome-settings-daemon metacity nautilus gnome-terminal openjdk-17-jre-headless 
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt install -yy wine wine32

vncserver :1

Open the configuration file in vim:

vim ~/.vnc/xstartup

and edits as follows at the bottom:
    
    [ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
    [ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
    xsetroot -solid grey
    
    vncconfig -iconic &
    gnome-panel &
    gnome-settings-daemon &
    metacity &
    gnome-terminal &



reat! We’re almost done with the configuration. Now, let’s restart the VNC server by killing it first and then starting it up.

To kill the vnc server and start it again, type the following command:

vncserver -kill :1
vncserver :1



#AUtoML

wget http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-3.44.0/1/h2o-3.44.0.1.zip
unzip ...

in order to start firefox remotely need to add the following if not add into xstartup:

xhost +localhost

or potentially:   
XAUTHORITY=$HOME/.Xauthority
export XAUTHORITY
